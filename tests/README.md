# Indeed Scraper Debugging Summary

This document outlines the debugging process undertaken to resolve a persistent `403 Forbidden` error from the Indeed scraper and provides recommended next steps.

## Debugging Summary

The core issue was that Indeed's servers were successfully identifying our scraper as a bot and blocking its requests. We systematically worked through several hypotheses to make our scraper appear more like a legitimate user.

1.  **Initial State**: The scraper was receiving `403 Forbidden` errors, indicating it was being blocked.

2.  **Hypothesis 1: User-Agent Mismatch**: We first suspected a mismatch between the `User-Agent` header (which was rotating through various desktop and mobile agents) and other headers that identified the client as a specific mobile app.
    -   **Action**: We modified the scraper to use only mobile-consistent user agents.
    -   **Result**: The `403` error persisted.

3.  **Hypothesis 2: Header Inconsistency**: We refined our approach by ensuring all request headers presented a single, consistent identity.
    -   **Action**: We updated the static headers in `jobspy/indeed/constant.py` to ensure the `user-agent` and `indeed-app-info` headers perfectly matched a modern iPhone device and app version.
    -   **Result**: The `403` error persisted.

4.  **Hypothesis 3: TLS Fingerprinting**: The continued blocking suggested a more advanced detection method. Standard Python HTTP libraries have a generic TLS (Transport Layer Security) "fingerprint" that is easily identifiable as a bot.
    -   **Action**: We switched the Indeed scraper to use the `tls-client` library (`is_tls=True`), which is designed to mimic the TLS fingerprint of a real browser.
    -   **Result**: The `403` error persisted.

5.  **Hypothesis 4: TLS Fingerprint Mismatch**: This was the crucial insight. We discovered that while we were sending *iPhone headers*, the `tls-client` was still using its *default Chrome browser fingerprint*. This contradiction is a clear signal to bot detectors.
    -   **Action**: We configured the `tls-client` session for the Indeed scraper to use a specific `safari_ioss_17_0` fingerprint, ensuring the low-level TLS handshake matched the high-level request headers. We also added more verbose logging to confirm the headers being sent.
    -   **Result**: The `403` error still persists.

## Next Steps

Having corrected all identifiable inconsistencies in our request's identity, the most likely remaining cause is an **IP Address Block**.

Indeed has likely flagged the source IP address due to the series of previous automated requests and has issued a temporary block.

### Primary Recommendation: Use Proxies

The most effective way to bypass an IP block is to route traffic through a proxy server. This will change the source IP address of the requests.

You can add proxies to your `scrape_jobs` call like this:

```python
jobs = scrape_jobs(
    site_name=["indeed"],
    search_term="Python Engineer",
    location="New York, NY",
    proxies=["user:pass@host:port", "another_proxy:port"],
    verbose=2
)
```

If proxies are not available, waiting for a few hours may be sufficient for the temporary IP block to be lifted.
